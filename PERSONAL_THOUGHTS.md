# Personal Thoughts

1. **Building this AML system has taught me that attention to detail matters more than I initially thought** – catching small inconsistencies in data can prevent real problems down the line.

2. **Working with both backend and frontend reminds me that great products come from good communication between teams** – the Angular integration feels smoother when everyone understands the API design.

3. **Sometimes the best code decisions come from asking yourself "will future me understand this?"** – it's made me write clearer comments and structure my files better.

4. **I realize I'm more drawn to solving problems than just writing code** – the investigative part of building AML rules genuinely interests me more than the syntax.

5. **This project showed me that learning on the job beats any tutorial** – dealing with real data migrations and configurations has leveled up my practical skills significantly.

6. **I've learned to appreciate testing more – even just running through user flows manually reveals things that rushed development would miss.**

7. **There's something satisfying about seeing a feature go from idea to working implementation** – especially when the UI responds exactly how I imagined it would.

8. **I'm starting to understand that being "good at code" isn't just about knowing languages** – it's about understanding business logic, user needs, and writing code others can maintain.

9. **Debugging weird data issues has made me more patient** – sometimes the answer isn't clever code, it's just methodically checking assumptions one by one.

10. **I'm genuinely excited about where fintech is going** – being part of building compliance tools that actually help prevent financial crime feels like meaningful work, and that matters to me.
